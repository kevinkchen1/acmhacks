## Inspiration 
As college students ourselves, we noticed a lack of resources on campus for tracking and monitoring fitness progress. We wanted to create a platform where students could easily set fitness goals, track their progress, and connect with others who are working towards similar goals.

## What it does 
MuscleMetrics is a web app that allows students to create and track fitness goals, monitor progress over time, and connect with other students who are pursuing similar goals. The app features personalized workout plans, progress tracking tools, and a social community to keep users motivated and accountable.

## How we built it 
MuscleMetrics was built using a combination of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap framework and Javascript for the user interface and functionality.

## Challenges we ran into 
One of the biggest challenges we faced was designing a user-friendly interface that could accommodate a wide range of fitness goals and activities. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
Seeing students connect with each other, share progress updates, and encourage one another has been incredibly rewarding. We're also proud of the overall design and functionality of the app, which we believe makes tracking fitness progress easy and intuitive.

## What we learned 
We learned a lot about the details of fitness tracking and the challenges of building a social community within an app. We also learned about the importance of user testing and incorporating feedback into our design process.

## What's next for MuscleMetrics 
We plan to continue expanding our library of workout plans and nutrition recommendations. We also hope to add more advanced tracking features like heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking. Ultimately, our goal is to create a comprehensive platform for all aspects of fitness tracking and goal-setting.
